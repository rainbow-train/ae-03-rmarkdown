# Background

This repository is part of the ghe-learn course. In this exercise, we explore two different document/file formats: (1) Markdown, and (2) R Markdown.

# Markdown Syntax

Markdown is a way to format text that looks great on any device. It doesn't do anything fancy like change font size, color, or type - it just does the essentials using keyboard symbols that you already know.

# Outputs

I can create several outputs from a Markdown file. That includes HTML, PDF, or even MS Word.

# File format

Markdown is a markup language and a non-proprietary open file format that contains plain text and is machine readable.
