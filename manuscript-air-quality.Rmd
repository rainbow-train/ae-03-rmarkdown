# Background

This exercise is part of a workshop by the Global Health Engineering Group at ETH Zurich.

```{r}

library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(DT)
library(lubridate)

```

# Data

```{r}

data_link <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Global-Health-Engineering/manuscript-hospital-air-quality/main/data/intermediate/malawi-hospitals-air-quality.csv"

data_in <- read_csv(data_link)

```

# Exercise 1

```{r transform-summary}

dat_in_sum_day <- data_in %>% 
  filter(value <= 1000) %>% 
  mutate(date = as_date(date_time)) %>% 
  group_by(date, location, indicator) %>% 
  summarise(min = min(value),
            median = median(value),
            mean = mean(value),
            sd = sd(value),
            max = max(value))

```

```{r}

dat_in_sum_day %>% 
  datatable()

```

# Exercise 2

- Can you also reproduce the plot that we created in Unit 2 of application exercise 2?
